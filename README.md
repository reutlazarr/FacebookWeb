Our workflow commenced with role allocation and task delegation at Jira.
Initially, Reut was assigned responsibility for the feed, while Bar handled registration and login.
We alternated roles during the development of our Facebook application, which can be accessed via git.
The feed is structured into components, all of which are interconnected within the main feed component. Additionally, all screens are linked within the APP component.
